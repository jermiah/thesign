## **Our Mission: Creating Many Stephen Hawkings**

Just as Stephen Hawking revolutionized physics despite his physical limitations through technology, we believe every person with a disability has the potential to change the world. **We're here to make many Stephen Hawkings** - empowering deaf and hard-of-hearing developers to build the future through accessible AI technology.

**Technology should amplify human potential, not limit it.**
